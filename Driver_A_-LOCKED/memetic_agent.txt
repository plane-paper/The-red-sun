Memetic information is, simply put, information that facilitates a specific form of comprehension of itself.
An interpretation of memetic information would do three major things to the victim of said interpretation:
1. The memetic information would force its own meaning into the recognition of the victim, causing a response.
2. The memetic information would encourage the victim to spread the information.
3. The victim would be unable to forget the information.
These three attributes distinguishes memetic information from normal information. 
Memetic information could be used to achieve multiple purposes. For easier understanding, imagine if one learns about their spouse 
cheating on them. This would immediately force them into the emotion of anger, hence forcing its meaning onto the victim, and force 
the victim to take certain actions; in this case, grief, seek revenge, maintain justice, etc. Moreover, it would be basically impossible 
to ask the victim to forget such an event due to the trauma it brings. Hence, such an information is memetic. Other examples of memetic 
information include religion, language, certain inside jokes that reference other events, etc.
Memetic information tend to spread because it benefits the victim. For example, in the aforementioned example, the victim would intentionally
spread the information to gain understanding and compassion from the general public. In the example of language, as the information spread,
victims can communicate much more effectively and fluently.
Finally, memetic information may not necessarily only cause an emotional response. For example, in the aforementioned example, the victim
would likely take physical actions in response to the drastic sadness and disappointment felt by them. Such a response could be stimulated
directly by a memetic agent, which/who would greatly influence the targets' mental state by exposing them to selected memetic information.
For more information, refer to the section discussing memetic agents.
